            <p>
                Anna Grigoryevna Dostoevskaya was thirty-four when her husband died. She would live another thirty-seven years — longer as his widow than as his wife. She never remarried. She devoted the rest of her life to his memory.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was not passive mourning. Anna became an editor, publisher, archivist, and memoirist. She collected his letters, organized his manuscripts, annotated his works, and fought to ensure that Dostoevsky's legacy would endure. Without her efforts, much of what we know about him would be lost.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Publishing Revolution</h2>
            
            <p>
                During Dostoevsky's lifetime, Anna had pioneered a new approach to publishing. She bypassed traditional publishers and sold his books directly to readers, cutting out middlemen and dramatically increasing their income. She set up a mail-order system, handled fulfillment herself, and turned their apartment into a distribution center.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After his death, she continued and expanded this work. She published multiple editions of his complete works, ensuring they remained in print and accessible. She fought pirated editions and unauthorized translations. She became one of Russia's first successful self-publishers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The business skills she developed while managing his gambling debts and household finances served her well. By the time of her death in 1918, Dostoevsky's works had sold hundreds of thousands of copies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Archive</h2>
            
            <p>
                Anna was meticulous about preservation. She saved everything: manuscripts, notebooks, letters, business records, even scraps of paper with his handwriting. She organized the materials chronologically and thematically. She created inventories and finding aids.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also collected materials from others. She wrote to his correspondents asking for copies of his letters. She gathered reminiscences from friends and family. She tracked down documents from his prison years, his military service, his publishing ventures.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result was one of the most complete literary archives in Russian history. Scholars still rely on the materials Anna assembled. Her organizational system became the foundation for all subsequent Dostoevsky scholarship.

            <p>
                In her final years, Anna wrote her memoirs, published posthumously as <em>Reminiscences</em>. The book provides an intimate portrait of Dostoevsky that no biographer could match — his working habits, his moods, his tenderness with their children, his struggles with epilepsy and gambling.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She wrote with clear eyes. She did not hide his faults: the gambling that impoverished them, the jealousy that could be suffocating, the mood swings that made him difficult to live with. But she also showed the man behind the legend — vulnerable, loving, deeply dependent on her.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The <em>Reminiscences</em> are essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Dostoevsky. They preserve details that would otherwise be lost: how he composed, what he said about his characters, what made him laugh, what made him weep.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The First Museum</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 1906, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, Anna established the first Dostoevsky museum room in the Historical Museum in Moscow. She donated manuscripts, personal objects, and memorabilia. She oversaw the installation herself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a revolutionary concept for Russia — a museum dedicated to a writer, treating literature as national heritage deserving of preservation. Anna understood that memory requires physical spaces, that readers want to see where their heroes lived and worked.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today there are Dostoevsky museums in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Omsk, and other cities. Anna's 1906 installation was the first — the seed from which a tradition grew.

            <p>
                Anna raised their two surviving children alone: Lyubov (born 1869) and Fyodor (born 1871). Two other children had died in infancy — Sonya at three months, Alexei at three years.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lyubov, who called herself Aimée, became a writer and published a biography of her father. Her account is more critical than her mother's, reflecting a complicated relationship with Dostoevsky's legacy. Fyodor became a horse breeder and lived quietly, avoiding the literary world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anna outlived both the Revolution and the First World War. She died in Yalta on June 9, 1918, at the age of seventy-one, as the old Russia was collapsing around her. She was buried in the Crimea, far from her husband's grave in St. Petersburg.

            <p>
                In 1968 — fifty years after her death — Anna's remains were exhumed and reburied beside Dostoevsky in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in St. Petersburg. The Soviet government, which had long been ambivalent about Dostoevsky's religious and anti-revolutionary views, had finally acknowledged his importance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They lie together now, as they lived for fourteen years: the novelist and the stenographer, the gambler and his salvation, the man who created worlds with words and the woman who preserved them for us.

            <p>
                Literary history often forgets the wives. They appear as footnotes, as sources of domestic support, as obstacles to genius. Anna Dostoevskaya was something more: a full partner in her husband's work and legacy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She saved him from Stellovsky's trap. She transcribed his greatest novels. She managed his finances, ended his gambling, raised his children, and nursed him through his final illness. Then she spent thirty-seven years ensuring that the world would remember.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without Anna, there might be no <em>Gambler</em>, no recovery from debt, no peaceful years of creation. Without Anna's archive, scholars would lack essential materials. Without Anna's memoirs, we would not know Dostoevsky as a man — only as a name on a spine.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was twenty when she knocked on his door. She was seventy-one when she died, still at work on his legacy. The corn of wheat fell into the ground; Anna made sure it brought forth fruit.
