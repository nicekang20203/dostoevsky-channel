            <p>
                In 1865, Fyodor Dostoevsky was drowning. His brother Mikhail had died the previous year, leaving behind a failed literary journal and massive debts. Dostoevsky, feeling honor-bound to provide for Mikhail's family, assumed the obligations. But a writer's income, even a famous writer's, could not cover them.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Enter F.T. Stellovsky, a publisher with a reputation for predatory contracts. He offered 3,000 rubles in advance — desperately needed cash — for the rights to publish Dostoevsky's collected works. The catch: Dostoevsky must also deliver a new novel by November 1, 1866.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he failed, Stellovsky would own the rights to everything Dostoevsky wrote — past, present, and future — for nine years. Without payment. Stellovsky was betting that Dostoevsky, already overcommitted to serializing <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, would default.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">October 1866</h2>
            
            <p>
                By October, Dostoevsky had written nothing for the Stellovsky contract. He was consumed by <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, which was appearing in monthly installments in <em>The Russian Messenger</em>. He had less than a month. Friends suggested he hire a stenographer and dictate the novel.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pavel Olkhin, who ran a stenography school, recommended his best student: Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina, twenty years old, the daughter of a minor civil servant who had died two years earlier. She was serious, capable, and desperately needed the income.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On October 4, 1866, Anna arrived at Dostoevsky's apartment. She found a man of forty-four, exhausted, irritable, clearly unwell. He suffered from epilepsy. He was a widower. He was in debt. He was also one of the most famous writers in Russia.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Working Method</h2>
            
            <p>
                They developed a routine. Anna would arrive at noon. Dostoevsky would pace the room, smoking, dictating in bursts. She took down his words in shorthand, a system invented by her teacher Olkhin based on German models.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Each evening, Anna would return home and transcribe the day's work into longhand. The next day, Dostoevsky would revise her transcription while dictating new material. It was grueling work — four to six hours of dictation daily, then hours more of transcription.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anna was not merely a secretary. She calmed his anxieties. She kept him on schedule. When he despaired of finishing, she encouraged him. When he got lost in digressions, she gently steered him back. She was twenty years old and she was managing a genius.

            <p>
                Stellovsky had one final trick. When Dostoevsky came to deliver the manuscript on October 31, the publisher was conveniently "out of town." His office was closed. No one would accept the manuscript or provide a receipt.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Dostoevsky could not prove delivery by November 1, he would be in default. Friends advised him to take the manuscript to a police station and obtain an official receipt. He did so, timestamped October 31.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Stellovsky returned and tried to claim default, the police receipt was produced. The contract was fulfilled. Dostoevsky's future was saved.

            <p>
                With the deadline met, there was no professional reason for Anna to return. But Dostoevsky asked if she might help him with future work. She agreed. The sessions continued, now without urgency, with time for conversation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On November 8, Dostoevsky asked Anna's opinion of a plot he was considering. An aging artist, he said, falls in love with a young woman named Anya. What does she think would happen? Would such a girl accept him?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anna understood that it was no fiction. She answered: "I would answer that I love you and will love you all my life."

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">What the Sprint Revealed</h2>
            
            <p>
                Twenty-six days taught them both what they needed to know. Dostoevsky discovered that Anna was not intimidated by his fame, his age, his illness, or his moods. She met his intensity with calm competence. She was strong enough to manage him.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anna discovered that Dostoevsky, beneath the anxiety and irritability, was a man of passionate feeling and profound depth. His work ethic astonished her. His gratitude for her help was genuine. He needed her — not as a nurse or a servant, but as a partner.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 26-day sprint was not just the making of a novel. It was the audition for a marriage that would last until his death — and, in Anna's devoted preservation of his legacy, long after.
