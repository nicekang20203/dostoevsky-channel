            <p>
                Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky was born on November 11, 1821 (October 30 in the old Julian calendar), not in a comfortable middle-class home, but in a hospital for the destitute. His father, Mikhail Andreevich Dostoevsky, worked as a staff physician at the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor on the outskirts of Moscow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hospital was a charity institution serving those who could afford nothing — peasants, beggars, the homeless, and the desperate. The Dostoevsky family lived in a small apartment within the hospital complex, in the right wing of the building. Young Fyodor's bedroom window looked out onto the hospital cemetery.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From his earliest years, Dostoevsky witnessed scenes that most children never see: the dying, the grieving, the cast-offs of Russian society filing through the corridors. This proximity to suffering would mark his entire literary vision. Unlike Tolstoy, who discovered poverty intellectually as an adult, Dostoevsky was born into its presence.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Family Apartment</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Dostoevsky apartment was modest — just two rooms for a family that would eventually include seven children. The atmosphere was strict and religious. Mikhail Andreevich ran the household with military discipline, a habit from his years as an army surgeon during the Napoleonic Wars.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the cramped quarters and the grim surroundings, Maria Fyodorovna, Dostoevsky's mother, created a warm domestic life. She taught the children to read using the Bible and religious stories. Evening readings were a family ritual, with Mikhail Andreevich reading aloud from Karamzin's <em>History of the Russian State</em> while the children listened.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contrast between the warmth inside and the suffering outside would become a recurring pattern in Dostoevsky's fiction — the small islands of love surrounded by vast oceans of human misery.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Moscow in 1821</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Moscow of Dostoevsky's birth was still recovering from Napoleon's invasion nine years earlier. The great fire of 1812 had destroyed three-quarters of the city. Reconstruction was ongoing, and the city was a mixture of new classical buildings and blackened ruins.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia itself was at a crossroads. Tsar Alexander I, who had defeated Napoleon, flirted with liberal reforms but ultimately retreated into mysticism and reaction. The Decembrist uprising of 1825 — when Dostoevsky was four years old — would crush hopes for constitutional reform and inaugurate thirty years of repression under Nicholas I.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the Russia into which Dostoevsky was born: a nation caught between East and West, between reform and autocracy, between the glittering aristocracy of St. Petersburg and the grinding poverty of the Russian masses.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Early Influences</h2>
            
            <p>
                The hospital environment exposed young Fyodor to the full spectrum of human existence. He saw patients arrive in desperation and leave either healed or in coffins. He watched his father treat the poor with professional detachment that sometimes bordered on coldness. He observed his mother's gentler approach — she would often visit patients and bring them small comforts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These early impressions planted seeds that would flower decades later. The cramped rooms of the Marmeladov family in <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, the hospital scenes in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, the desperate poverty that drives so many of his characters — all trace back to that apartment in the right wing of the Mariinsky Hospital.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike writers who had to research poverty, Dostoevsky simply remembered it.

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Naming</h2>
            
            <p>
                He was baptized Fyodor, after his paternal grandfather. The name means "gift of God" in Greek — an irony not lost on a writer who would spend his life wrestling with questions of faith and divine providence.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His patronymic, Mikhailovich, marked him as the son of Mikhail. In Russian culture, this middle name would follow him through life, used in formal address: Fyodor Mikhailovich. It was how his friends, his enemies, his readers, and eventually all of Russia would know him.
