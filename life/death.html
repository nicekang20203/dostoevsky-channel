            <p>
                In late January 1881, Dostoevsky was at the peak of his fame. <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> had been completed the previous November. His speech at the Pushkin celebration the previous June had been a national sensation. He was working on the next issue of <em>A Writer's Diary</em> and planning a sequel to <em>Karamazov</em>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 26, he suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage — likely caused by emphysema, the result of years of heavy smoking. He seemed to recover, but on January 28, another hemorrhage struck while he was arguing with his sister about their inheritance from an aunt. This one was severe.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He lived for two more days, drifting in and out of consciousness. Anna never left his side. On the evening of February 9, 1881 (January 28 in the old calendar), Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky died at the age of fifty-nine. Anna would later write that his face in death was "calm and beautiful, as if he were resting."

            <p>
                The response was extraordinary. News of his death spread through St. Petersburg within hours. The next morning, crowds began gathering outside his apartment. Delegations from literary societies, universities, and government offices arrived with wreaths. Students kept vigil. Strangers wept in the street.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The funeral procession on February 12 was one of the largest in Russian history. Contemporary accounts estimate between 30,000 and 60,000 mourners — an astonishing number for a writer in an age before mass media. The procession stretched for more than a mile. Seventy-two delegations carried wreaths. Fifteen choirs sang hymns.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was buried at the Tikhvin Cemetery in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, not far from the graves of the composers Glinka and Mussorgsky. The tombstone bears a quotation from John 12:24: "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">A Nation's Prophet</h2>
            
            <p>
                What accounts for this outpouring? Other great writers had died without such spectacle. The answer lies in what Dostoevsky had become for Russia: not just a novelist but a moral voice, a prophet who spoke to the deepest anxieties of his time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an age of nihilism and revolutionary terror, he had insisted on the reality of the soul, the necessity of faith, the possibility of redemption. In an age of Western rationalism, he had championed the Russian Orthodox tradition. In an age of class warfare, he had preached universal brotherhood.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Conservatives mourned him as a defender of tradition. Radicals, even those he had criticized, recognized him as an honest voice. Ordinary Russians, many of whom had never read his novels, knew him from <em>A Writer's Diary</em> as someone who spoke directly to them, who understood their sufferings and their hopes.

            <p>
                <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> was intended as the first of two novels. The second would have followed Alyosha into the world, perhaps into revolutionary politics, perhaps into marriage and spiritual crisis. Notes suggest that Alyosha might have committed a great crime before finding his way back to faith.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will never know. Dostoevsky's death at fifty-nine cut short one of the most ambitious literary projects in history. But perhaps the incompleteness is fitting. His great theme was that life resists closure, that questions of faith and meaning are never finally resolved, that the struggle continues until death — and beyond.

                Anna Grigoryevna outlived her husband by thirty-seven years, dying in 1918. She devoted the rest of her life to his memory: publishing his complete works, writing her memoirs, collecting his letters, and in 1906 establishing the first Dostoevsky museum room.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without Anna, much of what we know about Dostoevsky would be lost. Her diaries, her reminiscences, her careful preservation of manuscripts and correspondence — all ensure that we can still hear his voice today.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Eternal Questions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky left no system, no doctrine, no program. He left questions — the questions that still haunt us: Can we live without God? What is the price of freedom? How do we bear guilt? Is redemption possible? What does it mean to be human?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These questions do not have answers, at least not in any final sense. But Dostoevsky showed us how to ask them honestly, how to sit with them without fleeing into easy certainties, how to find meaning in the struggle itself.
