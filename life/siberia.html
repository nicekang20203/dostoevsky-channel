            <p>
                On Christmas Eve, 1849 — just two days after the mock execution — Dostoevsky was fitted with ten-pound leg irons and loaded onto an open sledge. He and his fellow prisoners traveled 2,500 miles across frozen Russia to the Omsk prison fortress in Western Siberia. The journey took nearly a month.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At Tobolsk, the wives of the Decembrist exiles (men imprisoned since the failed uprising of 1825) gave the prisoners copies of the New Testament. Dostoevsky would keep his copy for the rest of his life. It was the only book allowed in the prison, and he read it obsessively, finding in it a lifeline to meaning.

            <p>
                The Omsk prison was officially a "house of the dead" — hard labor in place of execution. Dostoevsky shared barracks with murderers, thieves, rapists, and soldiers who had struck their officers. He, as a nobleman and a political prisoner, was despised by the common criminals.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conditions were brutal: lice, filth, bitter cold in winter, stifling heat in summer. Prisoners were fed rotten food, beaten for minor infractions, and worked to exhaustion. Dostoevsky's health, already fragile, deteriorated badly. His epileptic seizures became more frequent and severe.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet he later wrote that prison gave him something priceless: knowledge of the Russian people. For the first time, the nobleman's son from Moscow lived among peasants, criminals, and outcasts — not as an observer but as one of them. He learned their language, their songs, their stories. He discovered that even the worst among them retained sparks of humanity.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Peasant Marey</h2>
            
            <p>
                In <em>A Writer's Diary</em>, Dostoevsky recalled a transformative moment from the prison years. During Easter, the prisoners became drunk and violent. Filled with hatred for these "beasts," Dostoevsky retreated to his bunk. There he remembered a childhood incident: a peasant named Marey who had comforted him when, as a terrified nine-year-old, he had imagined hearing a wolf in the woods.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The memory changed everything. He looked at the drunken prisoners again and saw them differently — not as beasts but as men, as the same Russian people from whom Marey had come. "That degraded peasant with shaved head and branded face, reeling with drink... may be that very Marey."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This shift — from contempt to compassion, from intellectual abstraction to lived encounter — became the foundation of his later work. He never romanticized the peasants or criminals, but he refused to dehumanize them.
            </p>

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The New Testament</h2>
            
            <p>
                The New Testament given him at Tobolsk was the only book he was allowed for four years. He read it constantly, memorizing passages, pondering every word. The faith of his childhood, taught by his mother, was tested and transformed in those cells.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What emerged was not simple piety but a faith forged in doubt — what he called believing "through the great crucible of doubt." He came to believe not because Christianity was rational or comfortable, but because Christ represented something beyond reason: love that persists even in the face of suffering, grace that reaches even to murderers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The great religious dialogues of his later novels — Ivan's rebellion, the Grand Inquisitor, Zosima's teaching — all have their roots in those Siberian readings.

            <p>
                In February 1854, Dostoevsky's prison term ended, but his punishment was not over. He was transferred to a line battalion in Semipalatinsk, near the Chinese border, to serve as a common soldier. He would remain there until 1859 — another five years of exile.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Semipalatinsk, he met and married his first wife, Maria Isaeva, a tubercular widow with a son. The marriage was unhappy from the start. He also resumed writing, tentatively at first, then with growing ambition. <em>The House of the Dead</em>, his fictionalized memoir of prison, would be his first major work after the return.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">What Siberia Made</h2>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky entered Siberia as a fashionable young writer with utopian socialist sympathies. He left as something else entirely: a conservative, a Christian, a man who had seen the depths of human nature and could no longer believe in rational progress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the transformation was not merely ideological. Siberia gave him his great subject: the human soul in extremity. He had seen men at their absolute worst — and witnessed unexpected acts of kindness and sacrifice. He understood, from the inside, what it meant to be cast out of society, to be numbered among the criminals, to face the void.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Raskolnikov's torment, the Underground Man's spite, Myshkin's holy foolishness, Stavrogin's emptiness, the Karamazov brothers' struggles — all were seeded in the Omsk prison. Siberia broke him and remade him. It was, he later said, the making of him as a writer.
