            <p>
                In the spring of 1845, Dostoevsky completed his first novel, <em>Poor Folk</em> (Бедные люди). He had resigned his engineering commission and was living in poverty, gambling on his literary dream. He gave the manuscript to his friend Dmitri Grigorovich, who passed it to the poet Nikolai Nekrasov.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nekrasov started reading at night. By four in the morning, he and Grigorovich were knocking on Dostoevsky's door, embracing him, shouting that he was a genius. That same morning, Nekrasov brought the manuscript to Vissarion Belinsky, the most influential literary critic in Russia.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A new Gogol has appeared!" Belinsky announced. The comparison was the highest possible praise — Gogol was the titan of Russian prose. Within days, Dostoevsky was the talk of literary St. Petersburg. He was twenty-four years old.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Novel</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Poor Folk</em> is an epistolary novel — told entirely through letters between Makar Devushkin, an aging copy-clerk, and Varvara Dobroselova, a young woman fallen on hard times. The two live in neighboring apartments and exchange increasingly desperate letters as their financial situations worsen.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What made the novel revolutionary was its treatment of the poor not as objects of pity but as full human beings with inner lives, dignity, and consciousness of their own suffering. Makar is painfully aware of how others see him; he reads Gogol's "The Overcoat" and is outraged by its portrayal of a poor clerk as a figure of fun.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this metafictional moment — a character criticizing his literary ancestor — Dostoevsky announced his artistic manifesto. The poor were not comic relief. They were not sentimental props. They were people, and their suffering demanded to be taken seriously.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Price of Fame</h2>
            
            <p>
                The sudden success went to Dostoevsky's head. By his own later admission, he became insufferable — vain, pompous, convinced of his own genius. At literary gatherings, he expected to be treated as the guest of honor. He dropped friends who didn't show sufficient respect.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The reaction was inevitable. His second novel, <em>The Double</em>, was poorly received. Critics who had praised <em>Poor Folk</em> now found his work tedious and pretentious. Turgenev and Nekrasov began writing satirical verses mocking his vanity. Belinsky cooled toward him.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By 1848, Dostoevsky was no longer the wunderkind of Russian letters. He was a has-been at twenty-six, struggling for money, watching former friends succeed while he floundered. This humiliation would have been painful enough. What came next was far worse.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Petrashevsky Circle</h2>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps seeking community, perhaps seeking purpose, Dostoevsky began attending meetings of the Petrashevsky Circle — a group of young intellectuals who gathered on Friday evenings to discuss banned books and utopian socialism. The discussions were more theoretical than practical, but in the repressive atmosphere of Nicholas I's Russia, even talking about socialism was dangerous.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On April 23, 1849, the secret police arrested thirty-four members of the circle, including Dostoevsky. His crime: reading aloud Belinsky's banned "Letter to Gogol." The literary career that had begun with such promise seemed to be over. In fact, the most important chapter was about to begin.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
            
            <p>
                The rise and fall of his early fame taught Dostoevsky lessons he never forgot. Success means nothing without substance. Critics are fickle. Pride comes before destruction. The world delights in humiliating those who fly too high.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More importantly, he learned that the poor — the losers, the failures, the humiliated — were his true subject. Not because they were virtuous or noble, but because they were human, and because he was one of them. The dandy who had briefly strutted through St. Petersburg salons would never forget that he was, at heart, a poor clerk's son who had grown up in a hospital for the destitute.
