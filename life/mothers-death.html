            <p>
                Maria Fyodorovna Nechayeva was born in 1800 into a merchant family. Unlike her stern husband, she brought warmth, culture, and tenderness into the Dostoevsky household. She was the one who taught young Fyodor to read, using the Bible and religious stories as his first texts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She gave birth to seven children in sixteen years — a toll that weakened her constitution. By the mid-1830s, she had developed tuberculosis, the great killer of the nineteenth century. There was no cure. The family could only watch her decline.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She died on February 27, 1837. Fyodor was fifteen years old. Decades later, he would still speak of her with deep emotion, and the idealized, suffering mother-figures in his novels — Sonya's mother in <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, the mothers in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> — all carry traces of Maria Fyodorovna.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Pushkin Coincidence</h2>
            
            <p>
                Just two days after Maria's death, Alexander Pushkin — Russia's greatest poet, Dostoevsky's literary idol — died in St. Petersburg from wounds received in a duel. Fyodor later said that he would have worn mourning for Pushkin even if his mother had not died.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The double loss marked a turning point. In a single week, he lost both his mother and the literary father-figure whose work had first awakened his passion for literature. The fifteen-year-old understood, perhaps for the first time, that death could strike anyone — even the great, even the beloved.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Sent to St. Petersburg</h2>
            
            <p>
                With his wife dead and seven children to provide for, Mikhail Andreevich made a practical decision: Fyodor and his elder brother Mikhail would be sent to the Military Engineering Academy in St. Petersburg. Engineering offered a secure career and a respectable position in society.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem was that Fyodor had no interest whatsoever in engineering. He wanted to be a writer. He spent his academy years reading voraciously — Pushkin, Gogol, Balzac, Hugo, Shakespeare, Schiller — while neglecting his technical studies. He graduated near the bottom of his class.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The academy years were lonely ones. He was poorer than most of his fellow students, awkward in social situations, and consumed by his secret literary ambitions. He later called these years "the most painful period of my life."

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Discovery of Literature</h2>
            
            <p>
                If the academy taught Dostoevsky nothing about engineering, it gave him access to the great works of European and Russian literature. He devoured everything: the Romantic poets, the French novelists, the German philosophers. He was particularly struck by Gogol's stories of St. Petersburg life, with their mixture of realism and grotesque fantasy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He began writing in secret — poetry at first, then prose sketches. He shared his ambitions only with his brother Mikhail, who remained his closest confidant. The letters between them during these years are full of literary discussion and youthful dreams of glory.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Void Left Behind</h2>
            
            <p>
                Maria's death left a void that Dostoevsky spent his life trying to fill. His letters reveal a man hungry for maternal affection, often seeking it in inappropriate places — from older women, from his first wife Maria Isaeva, and eventually finding it in the much younger Anna Snitkina.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The loss also intensified his religious sensibility. His mother had taught him to pray, to believe, to find meaning in suffering. When that faith would be tested in Siberia years later, it was her lessons he returned to — the Gospel she had read him as a child.
