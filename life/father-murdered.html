            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Official Story</h2>
            
            <p>
                On June 6, 1839, Mikhail Andreevich Dostoevsky was found dead on the road near the family's small estate at Darovoye, about 150 versts from Moscow. The official cause of death was recorded as an apoplectic stroke.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the rumors told a different story. According to family tradition and local gossip, he had been murdered by his own serfs — beaten to death, or perhaps smothered, by peasants who could no longer endure his harsh treatment. No investigation was conducted. No one was punished. The matter was quietly closed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fyodor was seventeen, still a student at the Engineering Academy in St. Petersburg. He received the news by letter. According to later accounts, the shock triggered his first epileptic seizure — though this may be legend rather than fact.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">What Really Happened?</h2>
            
            <p>
                The truth remains uncertain. Modern scholars have questioned whether the murder even occurred. The only contemporary evidence is the death certificate listing apoplexy, and some historians argue that the murder story was a later embellishment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the circumstantial evidence is suggestive. After his wife's death in 1837, Mikhail Andreevich had spiraled into depression and heavy drinking. He retired to Darovoye permanently and, according to accounts, became increasingly brutal toward his serfs. He took a peasant mistress and may have fathered an illegitimate child. He was deeply unpopular on the estate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether or not the serfs actually killed him, Dostoevsky clearly believed they did — or at least believed it was possible. The question of patricide, and the guilt of those who wish for a father's death, would become central to his final masterpiece.

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Psychology of Patricide</h2>
            
            <p>
                Freud famously argued that <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> was shaped by Dostoevsky's own unconscious patricidal wishes, and his guilt over those wishes. Whether or not Freud was right about the psychology, the biographical parallels are striking.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the novel, the dissolute Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered by his illegitimate son Smerdyakov, but the guilt spreads to all three legitimate sons — particularly Ivan, whose philosophy of "everything is permitted" provides the intellectual justification for the crime. The question haunting the novel is the question that haunted Dostoevsky: does wishing for a death make one guilty of it?

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Aftermath</h2>
            
            <p>
                Mikhail Andreevich left little money. The estate at Darovoye was divided among the children, but Fyodor renounced his share in favor of his siblings. He would struggle with poverty for most of the next thirty years.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The death also left him an orphan at seventeen — mother dead two years, father now gone. He had his brother Mikhail, but the older generation was erased. He was alone in St. Petersburg, studying a subject he hated, dreaming of a literary career that seemed impossibly distant.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some biographers see the father's death as the event that finally freed Dostoevsky to become a writer. As long as Mikhail Andreevich lived, Fyodor was expected to pursue the respectable engineering career his father had chosen for him. With the father dead, there was no one to disappoint.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Forty Years of Silence</h2>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky rarely spoke of his father's death. In his letters and notebooks, there is a conspicuous absence of reflection on this formative event. He mentioned his mother often, with tenderness; his father, almost never.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, written in 1879-1880, broke that silence. The novel is, in many ways, a forty-year meditation on the murder at Darovoye — an attempt to understand what it means to kill a father, to wish a father dead, to be freed by a father's death.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the end, Dostoevsky's answer is complex. Guilt spreads like contagion. Ivan's atheism enables Smerdyakov's act. Dmitri's hatred provides the motive. Even Alyosha, the saintly brother, is implicated. The only escape from the cycle of guilt is not innocence but grace — the kind of grace Zosima preaches and Alyosha embodies.
