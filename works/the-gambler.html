            <p>
                In 1865, Dostoevsky was drowning in debt. His brother Mikhail had died the previous year, leaving massive obligations that Fyodor felt honor-bound to assume. Desperate for cash, he signed a contract with the publisher F.T. Stellovsky: 3,000 rubles in advance for a new novel, to be delivered by November 1, 1866.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The catch: if Dostoevsky failed to deliver, Stellovsky would own the rights to all his works — past and future — for nine years. It was a predatory deal, and Stellovsky knew it. He was betting that Dostoevsky, already overcommitted to serializing <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, would default.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By October, Dostoevsky had written nothing. Friends suggested he hire a stenographer to dictate the novel. On October 4, a twenty-year-old woman named Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina arrived at his apartment. Twenty-six days later, the novel was complete. Four months after that, they were married.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Story</h2>
            
            <p>
                Alexei Ivanovich is a young tutor employed by a Russian general living abroad in the fictional German spa town of Roulettenburg. The General is waiting for his wealthy aunt, "Granny," to die so he can pay his debts and marry the beautiful but mercenary Mlle. Blanche.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexei is in love with Polina, the General's stepdaughter, who treats him with contemptuous cruelty. When she asks him to gamble for her at roulette, he discovers a terrifying aptitude — and an even more terrifying compulsion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plot takes a comic turn when Granny arrives, very much alive, and proceeds to lose a fortune at roulette herself. But Alexei's addiction is no comedy. By the novel's end, he has abandoned everything — love, honor, future — for the spinning wheel. He tells us he can quit whenever he wants. We know he never will.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Autobiography in Fiction</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Gambler</em> is the most autobiographical of Dostoevsky's major works. He knew gambling addiction from the inside — the irrational certainty that the next spin will change everything, the promise to quit that dissolves the moment you enter the casino, the degradation of borrowing money you can never repay.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the early 1860s, he had lost catastrophically at the roulette tables of Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, and Homburg. He pawned his watch, his wife's jewelry, even his winter coat. He wrote begging letters to friends, family, anyone who might send money — which he would immediately lose.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The novel captures this experience with clinical precision: the magical thinking, the superstitious systems, the contempt for "careful" gamblers who play for small stakes, the ecstasy of winning and the black despair of loss — which somehow only intensifies the desire to play again.

                <strong>Addiction as Spiritual Disease:</strong> Alexei knows that gambling is destroying him, yet the knowledge provides no defense. This prefigures modern understanding of addiction — not as moral weakness but as a hijacking of the will itself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Russians vs. Europeans:</strong> The novel contrasts "Russian" gambling — wild, all-or-nothing, contemptuous of calculation — with European prudence. Dostoevsky both mocks and celebrates Russian recklessness.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Money and Love:</strong> Every relationship in the novel is contaminated by financial calculation. The General needs Granny's money. Blanche needs the General's money. Polina owes money to the villain Des Grieux. Only Alexei's addiction is "pure" — he gambles for the gambling itself.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Anna's Role</h2>
            
            <p>
                The novel exists because of Anna Snitkina. Working four to six hours a day, she took down Dostoevsky's dictation in shorthand, then transcribed it each evening. Her efficiency and calm professionalism kept the project on track even as the deadline approached.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The manuscript was delivered to Stellovsky on October 30 — with one day to spare. Legend has it that Stellovsky was out of town, hoping Dostoevsky would miss the deadline; a receipt from a police station confirmed delivery.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A week later, Dostoevsky proposed — through a story, as the novel itself describes. He asked Anna's opinion of a plot where an aging artist falls for a young woman. She knew it was no fiction. "I would answer that I love you and will love you all my life."

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Cure</h2>
            
            <p>
                After their marriage in 1867, Anna accompanied Dostoevsky to European casinos — and watched him lose everything, again and again. She endured the pawning of her possessions, the begging letters, the broken promises. But she never condemned him.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 1871, after a particularly devastating loss at Wiesbaden, Dostoevsky had what he described as a mystical experience. He wrote to Anna that he had dreamed of his father and felt that something terrible would happen if he continued gambling. He never gambled again.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anna's patient love — her refusal to shame him, her practical management of their finances, her steady presence — had succeeded where willpower alone had failed. The novel written to save his career had introduced him to the woman who saved his life.
