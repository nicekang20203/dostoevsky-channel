            <p>
                In November 1869, a young revolutionary named Sergei Nechayev organized the murder of a fellow student, Ivan Ivanov, who had questioned his leadership. The killing, by a five-member cell in Moscow, was meant to bind the conspirators together through shared guilt.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky, living in Dresden, followed the case obsessively. Here was proof of everything he had warned against: the logical endpoint of nihilism, the revolutionary who kills not for liberty but for power, the ideology that justifies any means.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Demons</em> began as a satirical attack on the radicals. But as Dostoevsky wrote, the novel transformed into something stranger and more profound — a meditation on the spiritual emptiness that makes political extremism possible.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Story</h2>
            
            <p>
                In a provincial Russian town, a group of nihilists gathers around Pyotr Verkhovensky, a scheming manipulator who plans revolution for its own sake. His puppet master — or so Pyotr believes — is Nikolai Stavrogin, a charismatic aristocrat who inspires devotion in everyone he meets.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Stavrogin is hollow. He has tried everything — debauchery, marriage to a crippled woman, confession of terrible crimes — and felt nothing. He cannot believe or disbelieve, love or hate. His spiritual emptiness is the void around which the other characters orbit.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The novel spirals toward catastrophe: murder, suicide, fire, madness. Pyotr's cell kills one of their own (as Nechayev did). Stavrogin hangs himself. The promised revolution never comes — only destruction, meaningless and complete.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Stavrogin's Confession</h2>
            
            <p>
                A chapter titled "At Tikhon's" was cut from the original publication — too scandalous for the censors and even for the editors of <em>The Russian Messenger</em>. In it, Stavrogin confesses to the monk Tikhon that he once molested a young girl who subsequently hanged herself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The confession is not remorse. Stavrogin confesses because he hopes to feel something — shame, punishment, absolution. But Tikhon sees through him: his confession is itself a form of pride, a performance. Stavrogin leaves unchanged, and the chapter was not published in full until decades after Dostoevsky's death.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suppression matters. Without it, Stavrogin's emptiness seems almost glamorous. With it, we see the depths of his corruption — and the possibility that even corruption is a kind of spiritual death, preferable to feeling nothing at all.

                <strong>Nihilism as Spiritual Disease:</strong> The revolutionaries are not wrong because their politics are bad. They are wrong because they have lost their souls. Without God, without transcendent values, they have nothing to live for — so they live for destruction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Fathers and Sons:</strong> Stepan Verkhovensky's generation of Westernizing liberals, Dostoevsky argues, created the conditions for their children's nihilism. Soft atheism became hard; humanism became murder.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>The Possessed:</strong> The title comes from Luke 8:32-36 — the demons cast out by Christ enter a herd of swine, who rush into the sea and drown. Russia, Dostoevsky suggests, is possessed by Western ideas that must be expelled, even at terrible cost.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Prophecy</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Demons</em> was written in 1871-72. The Russian Revolution occurred in 1917. Readers in the twentieth century were stunned by how precisely Dostoevsky had predicted the methods and mentality of totalitarianism.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shigalyov's system — "starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism" — describes the trajectory from revolutionary idealism to Stalinist terror. Pyotr's cynical manipulation of true believers anticipates every revolutionary vanguard. The murder of Shatov — to bind the cell through shared guilt — became standard practice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky did not predict the specific events of 1917. He did something more important: he understood the spiritual vacuum that made such events possible. When meaning is destroyed, demons rush in.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Demons</em> is not a comfortable book. Its politics are reactionary; its portrait of revolutionaries is vicious; its spiritual message can seem like an endorsement of autocracy. Liberal readers have always squirmed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the novel transcends its politics because Dostoevsky understands his characters from the inside. Kirillov's atheist logic is compelling. Stavrogin's emptiness is seductive. The revolutionaries are not straw men but thinking human beings who have followed bad ideas to their logical conclusions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an age of ideological extremism — right and left, religious and secular — <em>Demons</em> remains urgent. It asks: what happens when people stop believing in anything larger than themselves? The answer, Dostoevsky saw, is demons.
