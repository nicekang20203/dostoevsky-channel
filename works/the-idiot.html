            <p>
                In his notebooks, Dostoevsky set himself a challenge: to create a "positively beautiful" character, a genuinely good man. He looked for models. Don Quixote? A comic fool. Jean Valjean? Too melodramatic. Only one figure satisfied him: "the most beautiful is Christ."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But how do you bring Christ into a contemporary Russian novel? The result was Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin — called "the idiot" because his innocence, his inability to dissemble or manipulate, looks like stupidity to a cynical world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dostoevsky knew the risks. The good are rarely interesting. Virtue can seem passive, even boring. His solution was to surround Myshkin with characters of enormous vitality and to make the Prince's goodness a catalyst for disaster. His very purity destroys everyone it touches.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Story</h2>
            
            <p>
                Prince Myshkin returns to Russia after years in a Swiss sanatorium, where he was treated for epilepsy. He is twenty-six, penniless, and utterly guileless. On the train to St. Petersburg, he meets the dark, charismatic Rogozhin, who is obsessed with a woman named Nastasya Filippovna.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nastasya is a "kept woman," beautiful and tormented, who was seduced and ruined as a teenager by her guardian Totsky. She despises herself and tests every man who claims to love her, seeking proof that someone can see past her degradation to her true self.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Myshkin sees. He offers her not desire but compassion. He proposes marriage — not from love but from pity. This enrages her as much as Rogozhin's possessive lust. She oscillates between them, fleeing to Rogozhin, returning to Myshkin, never able to accept the love she craves.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Myshkin becomes entangled with the proud, beautiful Aglaya Epanchin, who may genuinely love him. The Prince, incapable of choosing, manages to lose both women. The novel ends in madness, murder, and Myshkin's final collapse into "idiocy" — the disease returning to claim him.

            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Five Minutes</h2>
            
            <p>
                Early in the novel, Myshkin describes a man who faced execution — given five minutes to live before the rifles fired. The passage is Dostoevsky's own experience, transposed into fiction with searing immediacy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He said that those five minutes seemed to him an infinite time, a vast wealth... He was then twenty-seven. He said that nothing was so dreadful as the continual thought: 'What if I were not to die!... I would turn every minute into an age; I would lose nothing, I would count every moment separately, and waste nothing.'"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The man was pardoned. He did not live differently. He wasted his moments like everyone else. The ecstatic promise of those five minutes dissolved into ordinary life. This is the tragedy the novel explores: we know what matters, and we forget.

            <p>
                <strong>The Failure of Goodness:</strong> Myshkin's purity does not redeem the world; it exposes the world's corruption and ultimately is destroyed by it. His compassion becomes a catalyst for chaos.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Beauty and Suffering:</strong> "Beauty will save the world" — but what kind of beauty? Nastasya is beautiful, and beauty has brought her only suffering. The aesthetic and the moral do not align.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Epilepsy as Vision:</strong> Myshkin's epileptic auras give him moments of transcendent clarity — a feeling of absolute harmony, of understanding everything. But the seizures that follow erase the vision and damage his mind.

        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">The Holbein Christ</h2>
            
            <p>
                A pivotal scene centers on Hans Holbein's painting <em>The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb</em>, which Dostoevsky had seen in Basel. The painting shows Christ's corpse — greenish, decaying, utterly dead. No hint of resurrection.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Myshkin remarks that "that picture might make some people lose their faith." The novel poses the question: what if Christ is simply dead? What if there is no resurrection, no redemption, no meaning to suffering? Dostoevsky does not answer. He lets the question hang.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="detail-section">
            <h2 class="detail-section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Idiot</em> is Dostoevsky's most personal novel — not autobiographical in plot, but in feeling. Like Myshkin, he suffered from epilepsy. Like Myshkin, he knew the ecstasy before the seizure and the devastation after. Like Myshkin, he tried to bring Christ into the fallen world and watched the attempt fail.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The novel does not comfort. It does not promise that goodness will triumph. But it insists that goodness exists, that beauty is real, that compassion matters even when it fails. In a world where cynicism passes for wisdom, that insistence is itself a kind of faith.
